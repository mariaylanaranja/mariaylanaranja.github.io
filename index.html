         <p> In our project "Listening along the Vecht; Field-Notes and Reflections", we cycled from the Vecht’s discharge in the IJmeer to its point of origin at the Weerdsluis, mimicking part of the fish’s migration. We brought a hydrophone (a device that records sound underwater) with us and stopped occasionally to record the underwater sonic environments of the Vecht. Our equipment included two bikes, two backpacks, snacks, a field recorder, a hydrophone, two pairs of headphones, rain jackets, a pen, and a notebook. The choice of cycling was crucial, as it allowed us to follow the Vecht and its twists, enabling us to pass through different towns. Roughly, what we did could be summarised as cycling, stopping, connecting all the cables, dropping the hydrophone in the water, recording, unplugging everything again, packing everything tightly, drinking water, cycling some more, and repeating the process. Spending a whole day on this process allowed us to move at a human pace along the Vecht, encountering light rain showers, mud, other vehicles, and crossing small bridges. The audio you are now listening to is a montage of these recordings, something like a sonic journey through the river or a reconstruction of the fish’s migration. The goal of this project is to ask ourselves what happens when we try to understand aquatic environments differently and how this can lead to a more thorough understanding of these environments. </p>
         <p>This experience made us reflect deeply on how water influences our thinking. Below, we have collected our field notes, inspirational readings, reflections, and some strange conclusions inspired by our water-focused thinking process. In the button below, you can hear almost 30 minutes of recordings we did along the Vecht.</p>
         <p>But before you proceed, we have some advice for the reader: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Note on the audio: the volume fluctuates significantly throughout the recording. During our process, we kept the level of amplification more or less consistent. Because the first stops were relatively quiet, however, this means that certain loud environments are really quite loud. We thus caution against turning your own volume up too loud, and against increasing the volume in those sections when it might seem quiet or barely audible. Especially the last few minutes, recorded at the Weerdsluis as the lock filled up with water, are somewhat violent. Feel free to turn down the volume whenever you feel like it.</li>
                <li>Unless it is a case of extreme circumstance, we recommend reading this at a slower pace, following the stream of thought. We will, however, notify you when  and where to click on the audio so that what you are reading is coherent with what you hear.</li>
                <li>You will see that there is a lack of images, mainly because we actively decided not to photograph the underwater. It was important for us to have different senses as mediums to think with the Vecht. What you read is a collection of thoughts and noise.</li>

    <section id="Introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the city of Utrecht, just north of its historic centre, lies the Weerdsluis. One side of this lock is Utrecht’s canals, whereas the other side marks the beginning of the river Vecht. The Vecht meanders north through the provinces of Utrecht and North Holland, its water flowing past some small towns before discharging into the IJmeer. However, every year in springtime, the fish in the Vecht swim the other way. When temperatures start rising and the fish are looking to reproduce, the fish attempt to migrate from the Vecht, through Utrecht’s canals, and into the Kromme Rijn, a river to the southeast of Utrecht. Because of the Weerdsluis, the fish cannot swim into Utrecht’s canals when the lock is closed, which is most of the time. Having to wait and expend energy while waiting for the lock to close, the fish may become easy targets for birds of prey, were it not for the Visdeurbel (trans. Fishdoorbell). This project was initiated in 2021 by Utrecht’s municipality, the local water board, and ecologist Mark van Heukelem, recognising the importance of these fish in contributing to biodiversity and maintaining the health of Utrecht’s canals and rivers. An underwater camera was placed right outside the Weerdsluis, which, during migration season, continuously livestreams. Those watching the livestream can ‘ring the fishdoorbell’ when a fish swims by, notifying the lock tender that the Weerdsluis needs to be opened. The Visdeurbel is thus a crowdsourced mode of water management, one that has received worldwide popularity and drawn attention to the impact of human intervention on ecosystems, as well as to the inseparability of oft-perceived dichotomies like human/nature and urban/nature. However, the Visdeurbel presents only a small visual glimpse into the Vecht, which is not exhaustive and slightly anthropocentric, emphasising the fish’s necessity for the human to continue their journey </p>
        <p> Before embarking on our journey, we read and kept in mind the writings of other scholars and thinkers who have published their work on watery environments. Particularly pertinent to this research is the notion of  ‘wet ontologies’ (Steinberg and Peters, 2015). These ‘wet ontologies’ refer to various ways of thinking about the earth through or with water. Hence, the wetness of these ontologies. Thus, it was an intentional idea to understand the Vecht through a different method of study, especially one that would allow us to preserve our anthropocentric view, as we cannot turn into fish (so far) and back into humans, while also allowing us to listen to what the Vecht can tell us. We have attempted to counteract various taken-for-granted modes of understanding the Earth (one might call them dry ontologies) that prove unsustainable when placed in the context of the ocean, or watery environments in general. One example is the mapping of fishing zones, in which the strict borders and hard corners on maps bear little resemblance to the fluidity of the sea and the mobility of the fish.  </p>

   <section id="Field and Water Notes">
  <h2>Field and Water Notes</h2>
  <p> The first recording we made was at 12:51 CET alongside the Muiderweg. The day was grey and very windy. After some small technical difficulties, we assembled the hydrophone and dropped it in the water. We brought some headphones in order to be able to listen while recording. This step, therefore, was twofold: the intention of retaining the sound for later, while being able to elaborate notes on it while we listened to it live. The stream sounded rather steady, quiet and calm as you can see at the beginning of the audio. One of the main limitations of this mode of listening was the length of the hydrophone, which would not allow us to hear the Vecht beyond three or four meters of depth. When we left our first site, we realised that on the other side of the Vecht, there was a gigantic highway. This led us to pay more attention to other sounds that the hydrophone could capture.</p>
  <p> Another author similarly interested in the ways that watery environments complicate terrestrial understanding is Melody Jue. In her book Wild Blue Media, she draws on her experience as a scuba diver to note how much of human knowledge is shaped by the terrestrial environments that afford it. Under oceanic conditions (e.g. increased pressure, three-dimensional movement, different light refraction and sound dissipation), the production of knowledge might yield entirely different results. Jue thus develops a methodology of what she calls ‘conceptual displacement’, in which certain concepts are imaginatively submerged into the depths of the ocean. Herself engaging with media theory, Jue submerges concepts such as interface and inscription. The insight that knowledge is milieu-specific and particularly framed by its terrestrial conditions, however, also applies beyond her disciplinary focus on media theory.  </p>
  <p> It is important to note that Steinberg and Peters’ article, as well as Jue’s book, place particular importance on the ocean as both theoretical and material space which shapes ontology. For Steinberg and Peters, the centrality of the ocean is a product of their focus on the geo (as in geophysics, geology, geography, and geopolitics). Oceans are, as pointed out in the epigraph borrowed from William Langewiesche, ‘not the exception to our planet, but by far its greatest defining feature’. Similarly, Jue’s focus on the ocean is easily explained both by her experience as a scuba diver and her subsequent aim of investigating terrestrial-centric modes of understanding. Of course, the methodology of ‘conceptual displacement’ she develops is most expressive when those concepts are displaced into an environment most unlike their terrestrial ones; the ocean. However, this oceanic focus risks overlooking those bodies of water which we encounter in our everyday lives. That is not to say that the oceans do not play a role in our everyday life, but as both a space and a place it remains somewhat distant; we, the authors, have to make a conscious decision to travel to the seashore, whereas we cycle past the Vecht or Utrecht’s canals daily. Following Steinberg and Peters’ critique of those oceanic ontologies that too often remain abstract, we therefore shift our focus to the seemingly more mundane body of water with which we are more intimately familiar.</p>
  <p> It's 13:52 CET, we are sitting in an apparently calm area. We have done a few kilometres of our journey, we decided to drop the hydrophone in the water to listen, underwater. The total disruption between the above-water sound and the water is almost ridiculous. A loud metallic sound could be heard through the headphones. At first, we thought maybe it was our phones, or that we had broken the hydrophone. We lifted our gaze, and from a distance, we spotted the front of a boat. The sound of the boat could be heard from several meters away, all underwater! If you want to have a sense of how disruptive these sounds are, just play the recording attached above from minute 00:16:00 onwards. The metallic, loud noise, if intense for us, we cannot imagine how distressing it could be for the underwater creatures around the Vecht. How many other ways do we create uncanny sounds without even realising? How dare we invade their soundscape? </p>
  <p> We started our journey with a relatively passive approach, remaining open and interested in whatever sounds would come to wash over us. Nonetheless, a significant idea underpinning our fieldwork had been the hunch that these underwater sound environments or soundscapes, as R. Murray Shafer (1994) and many after him may have called them, would be significantly different from the terrestrial soundscapes past the Vecht. Why, otherwise, would we want to lower a hydrophone into the water? Actually, listening to that soundscape as we were recording was, of course, a wholly different experience from thinking beforehand about what those sounds might be. For example, it struck us just how significant and loud the sounds of boats were underwater, as compared to what we heard from the shore. Through the hydrophone, we could even at one point hear a boat coming, before it had come around the bend in the Vecht a few hundred meters over. </p>
  <p>However, we did wonder to what extent these recorded soundscapes constitute ‘experiencing’ the Vecht. Certainly, they pose a challenge to our terrestrial point of view, but how successful are they in immersing us in a watery environment? We turn to anthropologist Timothy Ingold, whose work has dealt at length with the phenomenology of environments. As Ingold writes, ‘[t]heories of how people perceive the world around them … generally work from the assumption that this world is terrestrial’. This is the same assumption that Steinberg and Peters, and Jue challenge in their work. Whereas those authors turn towards the sea, Ingold turns towards the sky. Nevertheless, parts of his discussion might be useful even when displaced to the watery conditions of the Vecht, and our journey alongside it.  </p>
  <p> The reason that Ingold focuses on the sky is that he wants to upend some stubborn conceptions about sensory experience, and especially about vision. Comparing sound and vision to each other, he writes:
‘We often think of sight as an objectifying sense. Standing here, we look and see that cloud there, or that tree, or that bird, each as an object that is set over against us, at a distance. But with hearing, it seems to be different. We say we hear sounds, as though we were bathed in them. They get inside us and shake us up. Indeed, hearing and the experience of sound appear to be one and the same. But if that is so, why cannot vision equally be an experience of light? Can we not be bathed in the fluxes of light just as much as we are in those of sound?’ (Ingold, 158).
 </p>
 <p> The sky, then, works to illuminate Ingold’s point because to see the sky is not so much to perceive an object as it is to experience the refraction of light. However, if the sky is indeed luminosity itself, what then is the Vecht? The sky indeed allows us to see through it, but the Vecht resists such an experience. Its shimmer does not allow us to see deeper, nor do we hear anything apart from the waves on the Vecht’s surface.</p>
 <p> 	It is 15.17 CET, we reached a bridge. The stream is steady. There are some weird sounds. Ah, another boat is coming. We are sitting on top of the bridge, so we can play with how far the hydrophone lies in the water. This opens a new layer of thought: how deep is the Vecht, and how many different environments can we interact with according to its depth? </p>
 <p> Ingold’s critique of the concept of soundscape follows a similar line, posing that sound is not an object which we observe but rather the medium through which we hear. Moreover, as he rightly points out, the environments through which we move are not themselves divided along the lines of our sensory pathways; a forest is not either visual or aural, but rather is both visible and audible, its experience stems from a total immersion into that environment. Once again, however, the environments he writes about are wholly different from the watery Vecht, which resists easy-going immersion. To see underwater, one needs goggles. Similarly, to hear the Vecht for extended durations of time and without the risk of an ear infection, this environment needs first to be recorded with a hydrophone. In the very act of attempting to immerse ourselves in the Vecht, we have thus rendered it aural. The flipside of this is that we have rendered it decidedly non-visual and non-tactile. Following Jennifer Gabrys and Helen Pritchard, we should consider the act of sensing the Vecht to not happen exclusively within ourselves, but rather to be shaped by a series of sense-affording technologies (Gabrys and Pritchard, 2018). The acknowledgement that these sensing practices shape our experience of particular environments, perhaps frees our Vecht soundscape somewhat from Ingold’s critiques, precisely because of the awareness that our Vecht soundscape is not a holistic experience of the Vecht, but rather the product of a series of entangled sensory tools and technologies. While acknowledging that this recording is thus not a complete immersion into the Vecht, we would like to flip Ingold’s critique on its head. If sound is indeed something in which we sense, then our field recordings might allow for a more thorough sensing of the Vecht, even from the terrestrial contexts in which the recording is played back to us. </p>

    <section id="Epilogue">
        <h2>Epilogue</h2>
        <p> Finally, we arrived at the Visdeurbel, it’s around 17:12 CET. We are at the very end of the journey. Utrecht, a familiar spot. The intensity of the Visdeurbel can be heard in the last minutes of our recordings. We asked for permission to record. Then we asked permission to swim. Swimming in the canal, in the centre of Utrecht, in the very dirty water, and trying to open our eyes underneath, we realised that, as much as we want to, we cannot see anything beyond ourselves. The stream and current let us flow, very slowly, it pushes us away from the Visdeurbel. We swim back, we can’t reach it. Behind us is the Dom, another crucial element of Utrecht’s identity. The swim is refreshing; however, not much can be seen, except for feeling the water. Moving within water is unnatural, and being able to listen to it is even more so. These experiment, however, has in some way brought us closer to the Vecht. Allowing us to guide us through the whole day, to listen to it, and finally swim within it, has given us a different understanding of the methods to understand the Vecht. </p>
        <p> As stated in the introduction, we do not wish to shed our anthropocentric view, and even if we did, we could not. Moreover, as we were confronted with during our field trip and while writing, it is quite difficult to experience and understand those watery environments that are so different from our own terrestrial ones. Yet, this should not stop us from trying, however incomplete and faulty, as these environments are both subject to human intervention and of vital importance to the well-being of their non-watery counterparts. This project has been one such attempt to gain a deeper understanding of what goes on in the Vecht. </p>
